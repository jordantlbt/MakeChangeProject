# Make Change Project

## Description
This project is my very first Java project.

The user will enter the dollar and change amount in the correct USD format
(example  00.00 ). The program should then be able to tell the user how much change is due and what dollar and coin types and quantities should be given back to the customer.

User must re-run the program every time to enter new amounts currently.

### What I learned
I had a lot of difficulty getting the math correct to calculate change. I was able to search through multiple websites and try to calculate the math on my own, using trial and error, to find a combination that would get me the results I wanted.

I learned a lot about if/else statements and how to make a variable continue through the statements even when it has fulfilled a statement.  


### Technologies used
Java, Eclipse, Atom, GIT, Google
